  "body": "# dotNetCore\r\n\r\nA simple introduction to Dot Net Core & ASP.Net core. We will be creating the console application without Visual Studio or any other editor. It will be purely from DOS prompt (Old school way - Believe me its so much fun)\r\n\r\n# your first dotNetCore application\r\n\r\n### Step 1 - [Download](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=827524) the DotNet Core SDK.\r\n\r\n### Step 2- Open command prompt & Create a folder DotNetCore on your C Drive (You can make a different directory of your choice of location). We will be using this folder to hold all of our examples & demo\r\n\r\n    C:\\>md dotNetCore\r\n    C:\\>cd dotNetCore\r\n    C:\\>dotNetCore>\r\n\r\n###  Step 3- Create another folder inside this & name it as firstConsoleApp\r\n\r\n    C:\\dotNetCore>md firstConsoleApp\r\n    C:\\dotNetCore>cd firstConsoleApp\r\n    C:\\dotNetCore>firstConsoleApp>\r\n\r\n> The folding structure matters here. the folder we will be using for creating the application counts for name space of the project name & assembly name here.\r\n\r\n### Step 4\r\nYou have installed dotNetCore by now and have a folder to work with also. Now its the time to create first project. Lets try out first by checking if dotNetCore is successfully installed\r\n\r\nTry the following command\r\n\r\n    C:\\dotNetCore>firstConsoleApp>dotnet\r\n\r\nIf every thing works fine, it should give version and build number. As of today I got following with some more detail \r\n\r\n    Microsoft .NET Core Shared Framework Host\r\n      Version  : 1.0.1\r\n      Build    : cee57bf6c981237d80aa1631cfe83cb9ba329f12\r\n\r\n    Usage: dotnet [common-options] [[options] path-to-application]\r\n    \r\n    Common Options:\r\n      --help                           Display .NET Core Shared Framework Host help.\r\n      --version                        Display .NET Core Shared Framework Host version.\r\n\r\n    Options:\r\n      --fx-version <version>           Version of the installed Shared Framework to\r\n    use to run the application.\r\n      --additionalprobingpath <path>   Path containing probing policy and assemblies to probe for.\r\n\r\n    Path to Application:\r\n      The path to a .NET Core managed application, dll or exe file to execute.\r\n    \r\n    If you are debugging the Shared Framework Host, set 'COREHOST_TRACE' to '1' in y\r\n    our environment.\r\n    \r\n    To get started on developing applications for .NET Core, install .NET SDK from:\r\n      http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=798306&clcid=0x409\r\n\r\n\r\n### Step 5 - Awesome, now we have everything ready, Lets create our first project. Write the command \"dotnet new\"\r\n\r\n    C:\\dotnetcore\\firstconsoleapp>dotnet new\r\n    Created new C# project in C:\\dotnetcore\\firstconsoleapp.\r\n\r\nYou will see 2 files created in the folder. \r\n\r\n    C:\\dotnetcore\\firstconsoleapp>dir\r\n     Volume in drive C is OS\r\n     Volume Serial Number is 5698-08AD\r\n    \r\n     Directory of C:\\dotnetcore\\firstconsoleapp\r\n    \r\n    10/14/2016  03:02 PM    <DIR>          .\r\n    10/14/2016  03:02 PM    <DIR>          ..\r\n    09/20/2016  12:08 AM               214 Program.cs\r\n    09/20/2016  12:08 AM               367 project.json\r\n                   2 File(s)            581 bytes\r\n                   2 Dir(s)  101,743,194,112 bytes free\r\n\r\n\r\nLet's see the content of these two files. Program.cs actually contains the application entry point. \r\n\r\n    C:\\dotnetcore\\firstconsoleapp>type program.cs\r\n    @using System;\r\n    \r\n    namespace ConsoleApplication\r\n    {\r\n        public class Program\r\n        {\r\n            public static void Main(string[] args)\r\n            {\r\n                Console.WriteLine(\"Hello World!\");\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nProject.json replaces the .csproj file and now it contains a list of all dependencies, environments, publish details etc.\r\n\r\n    C:\\dotnetcore\\firstconsoleapp>type project.json\r\n    {\r\n      \"version\": \"1.0.0-*\",\r\n      \"buildOptions\": {\r\n        \"debugType\": \"portable\",\r\n        \"emitEntryPoint\": true\r\n      },\r\n      \"dependencies\": {},\r\n      \"frameworks\": {\r\n        \"netcoreapp1.0\": {\r\n          \"dependencies\": {\r\n            \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\r\n              \"type\": \"platform\",\r\n              \"version\": \"1.0.1\"\r\n            }\r\n          },\r\n          \"imports\": \"dnxcore50\"\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThat's it. We have created our first console application. Let's compile it and run it now.\r\n",
