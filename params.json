  "body": "# dotNetCore\r\n\r\nA simple introduction to Dot Net Core & ASP.Net core. We will be creating the console application without Visual Studio or any other editor. It will be purely from DOS prompt (Old school way - Believe me its so much fun)\r\n\r\n# your first dotNetCore application\r\n\r\nStep 1 - Download(https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=827524) the DotNet Core SDK\r\n\r\nStep 2- Open command prompt & Create a folder DotNetCore on your C Drive (You can make a different directory of your choice of location). We will be using this folder to hold all of our examples & demo\r\n\r\n    C:\\mkDir dotNetCore\r\n    C:\\>cd dotNetCore\r\n    C:\\>dotNetCore>\r\n\r\nStep 3- Create another folder inside this & name it as firstConsoleApp\r\n\r\n    C:\\dotNetCore>mkDir firstConsoleApp\r\n    C:\\dotNetCore>cd firstConsoleApp\r\n    C:\\dotNetCore>firstConsoleApp>\r\n\r\n> The folding structure matters here. the folder we will be using for creating the application counts for name space of the project name & assembly name here.\r\n\r\nStep 4- You have installed dotNetCore by now and have a folder to work with also. Now its the time to create first project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
